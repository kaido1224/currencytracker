## About The Project

![Home Page Screen Shot][home-screenshot]

<p>
    My oldest son has recently acquired an interest in money from around the world and started building a collection. When it got beyond a collection of 30 different
    coins in various langauges, it became difficult for us to keep track of which coins came from where. So I built this compact project for my son to keep track
    of what currency he already has and what countries he still needs for his collection.
</p>

<p>
    On the home page, you can see a visual representation of the countries already in your collection as well as a table that displays a listing of the countries that you are 
    missing from your collection.

Below are instructions for setting up this project on your local machine. The shell commands below are written with Linux Ubuntu in mind. If you are using a different operating system, your instructions may vary.
</div>
<div id="prerequisites">

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Python 3.6+ virtual environment
  ```sh
  sudo apt install python3-venv
  ```
</div>
<div id="installation">
    
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kaido1224/currencytracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory created.
   ```sh
   cd currencytracker
   ```
3. Setup Python virtual environment
   ```sh
    python3 -m venv ve
   ```
4. Activate the new virtual environment
    ```sh
    . ve/bin/activate
    ```
5. Update pip
   ```sh
    pip install -U pip
   ```
6. Install the requirements file
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. If you didn't already have Postgres installed, follow the instructions below to set it up.
   ```sh
    sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser --createdb --pwprompt usernamehere
   ``` 
8. Create a database for CurrencyTracker in Postgres, assign it to your user.
   ```sh
    psql
    create database currency with owner usernamehere;
    \q
   ```
9. Create a secrets.py file under settings.
   ```sh
    sudo vim currency/settings/secrets.py
   ```

   Inside of the file, create a secrets dictionary similar to the below:
    ```py
    secrets_dict = {
        "SECRET_KEY": "DJANGOSECRETKEYHERE",
        "DB_USER": "YOURPOSTGRESUSERHERE",
        "DB_PASSWORD": "YOURPOSTGRESUSERPWHERE"
    }
   ```
    
   After that, save and exit.

10. Apply database migrations. If you want prepopulated data, access <i>myapp.0002_auto_20211210_0311.py</i> under myapp/migrations and uncomment out the
    book creation and currency bulk_create sections.
    ```sh
     ./manage.py migrate
    ```

11. Create a superuser to log into the project.
    ```sh
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

12. If done correctly, you should now be able to run CurrencyTracker in a development environment.
    ```sh
    ./manage.py runserver
    ```

13. In your browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000, you should see a login screen. Use the credentials you created in step 11 to login.
